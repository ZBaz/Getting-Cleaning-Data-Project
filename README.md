=============================

Geting and Cleaning Data Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to collect, work with and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. This project will have a script to create a tidy data set and a code book describing the variables. 

This readme file will explain how the runanalysis.R script works and what it does.
